## Why GFNs?
Many applications rely upon graphical data, which standard machine learning methods such as feedforward networks and convolutions cannot handle. GFNs present a novel approach of tackling this problem by extending existing machine learning approaches for use on graphical data. GFNs have very close links with neural operators and graph neural networks.

Key advantages of GFNs:
- Resolution invariance
- Equivalence to feedforward networks for single fidelity data (no deterioration in performance)
- Provable guarantees on performance for super- and sub-resolution
- Both fixed and adapative multifidelity training possible

## GFN-ROM
We show the capability of GFNs for MOR by developing the graph feedforward network reduced order model (GFN-ROM).

Key advantages of GFN-ROM:
- First graph-based resolution-invariant ROM
- Lightweight and flexible architecture
- Computational efficiency
- Excellent generalisation performance
- Adaptive multifidelity training
